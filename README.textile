h3. How to Use

First, be sure you have the echoe gem installed:
<pre><code>
  sudo gem install echoe
</code></pre>

Clone the gem:
<pre><code>
  git clone git@codaset.com:bcalloway/resmarkee.git
</code></pre>

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the gem and run:
<pre><code>
  rake gem manifest
  rake gem install
</code></pre>

Require the gem in your environment.rb file:
<pre><code>
  config.gem "resmarkee", :lib => "resmarkee"
</code></pre>

Vendor the gem:
<pre><code>
  rake gems:unpack
</code></pre>

Insert the following near the top of your environment.rb file:
<pre><code>
  USERNAME = 'myresmarkusername'
  PASSWORD = '123abc123abc123abc123abc'
  HOST = 'reservations.mydomain.com'
</code></pre>
_Note that you must have a valid username and password for accessing the Resmark Web Services._

Run the supplied generator from within your Rails app:
<pre><code>
  script/generate booking
</code></pre>

This installs the following template files:
<pre><code>
  |____controllers
  | |____bookings_controller.rb
  |____helpers
  | |____bookings_helper.rb
  |____models
  | |____booking.rb
  |____views
  | |____bookings
  | | |_____activities.html.haml
  | | |____index.html.haml
</code></pre>

Be sure to reference the required javascripts and stylesheets in your layout:
<pre><code>
  = stylesheet_link_tag 'http://jqueryui.com/latest/themes/base/ui.all.css'
  = javascript_include_tag :defaults, 'http://jqueryui.com/latest/ui/ui.datepicker.js', 'booking'
</code></pre>
